# Web Developer Portfolio
leroy.dev is my portfolio / ongoing project.

As a portfolio is some what a necessity, I use the opportunity to improve my skills and build upon what I learned from Dev Academy Aotearoa. Note that this is the type of project that one can constantly return to in order to update and improve upon.

ðŸ’» Love teaming up on exciting projects. Let's create something cool together.
