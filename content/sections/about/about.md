I recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa, transitioning from a background in design and marketing to a solid foundation in software development.

In 2023, I took a bold step into web development through a 15-week bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa. This immersive experience not only honed my technical skills but also developed essential human-centric abilities, providing a profound journey of self-discovery.

This comprehensive training equips me with a versatile toolkit for both technical and soft skills, preparing me for the challenges and innovations of the industry.
