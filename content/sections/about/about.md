As a software developer, I bring over a decade of experience in design, website management, and technology. I graduated with a Bachelor of Creative Technologies from Auckland University of Technology and recently completed a New Zealand Certificate in Applied Software Development. This involved a rigorous 15-week (70 hrs/week) full-stack software development boot camp, providing hands-on experience in a realistic team environment within an agile framework. The program placed significant emphasis on refining interpersonal skills, fostering collaboration, building technical expertise, and promoting mindfulness and well-being.
